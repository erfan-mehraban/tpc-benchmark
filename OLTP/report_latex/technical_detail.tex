    \subsection{Benchmark Apps}
    benchmark app used for testing Voltdb was developed by Voltdb official institution(*****) but had several bugs and missing feature. Some features like reporting more details about latency added and some bugs like stocking in load time solved but some others need huge refactor so we skipped it and this situation caused some missing report parameters.

    \subsection{Measurment Tools}
    we used Dstat for log system status. Dstat is a light system resource statistics recorder. After these data were collected, they were aggregated to generate proper plots and statistics to analyze them.\\
